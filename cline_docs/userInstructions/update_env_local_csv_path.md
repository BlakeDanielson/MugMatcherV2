It appears the application is loading an incorrect CSV file, leading to the "missing required fields" error. To resolve this, please update your `mug-matcher/.env.local` file.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Open the file:** `mug-matcher/.env.local`
2.  **Find the line** that starts with `MUGSHOTS_CSV_PATH=`.
3.  **Change the value** of `MUGSHOTS_CSV_PATH` to point to the correct CSV file, which should be located at `data/sorted_mugshots.csv`.

    Your updated line should look like this:
    ```
    MUGSHOTS_CSV_PATH=data/sorted_mugshots.csv
    ```
4.  **Save the file.**
5.  **Restart your Next.js development server** for the changes to take effect.

After completing these steps, the application should load the correct CSV data, and the error should be resolved.
